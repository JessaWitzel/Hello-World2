    <p><h1>About Me, Jessa Witzel</h1></p>
    <p>This is my first <em>About Me</em> page. Let me tell you a bit about myself.</p>
    <h4>My hobbies:</h4>
    <ul class = 'list'>
        <li><a href = 'http://riotousliving.com'>Gardening</a></li>
        <li><a href = 'http://courses.edx.org'>Learning new things (like how to code!)</a></li>

    <h4>Here are a few of my least favorite things:</h4>
    <ul class = 'list'>
        <li>Hotels that don't have hot tubs</li>
        <li>Dishonesty</li>
        <li>People who don't have any empathy at all</li>
        <li>Offices that are constantly too cold</li>
        <li>Meateaters who complain about me eating my happy chickens</li>
    </ul>
    <p id = 'selflove'>
        I am smart and I am capable and I am strong, which some people find intimidating. 
        It used to bother me when people told me I was intimidating but it doesn't anymore. 
        Why? Because <strong> I like myself</strong>. If you can't handle this excellence that
        is probably your problem.
